##About me
###Work
I am an application developer at a NYC nonprofit. I develop
Google Chrome extenstions and add-ons for teachers and 
administrators.

I've been developing for 2 years. My experience ranges
from front and back-end development to QA. In the short
term, I want to up my skills as a developer, mainly 
in front-end development.

I studied Psychology in unversity so in the long term,
I'd like to bring that aspect in my life again by 
working in the AI vicinity.

###Personal Life
Most of my life, I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Currently, I live in Manhattan, NY. Other places I've lived:
Manila, Los Angeles, and Davis, CA. I am involved in charities 
such as IIRR and Meals on Wheels. When I'm not programming, 
I love to travel, eat weird food, take muay thai classes, 
and read. 

###About this site
This site features posts about my journey in the tech industry.
Whether that touches back-end development, design, learning
new technologies, or my experience at a tech conference, 
I'd love to share each commit with the universe.
