      <h2> CSS Units</h2>
      <p>
        As a developer, sometimes you need to be flexible when it comes to sizing. Sometimes your designer won't budge<br>
        when it comes to making the size of the logo be relevant to the rest of the site. <br> So here you are, deciding whether you<br>
        should use a variety of units types or make all elements use the same units. Today I'd like to share a quick breakdown of some<br>
        of the units CSS has to offer. This is not an exhaustive list, but I'll highlight some common units and a couple unique ones.
      </p>

      <h3> Types of units</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, units are either <strong>relative</strong>or <strong>absolute</strong>. <br><br>
        A quick explanation... a <strong>relative</strong> unit is determined by values that are relative to another length.<br>
        An <strong>absolute </strong>unit is when a property's output is known/static.<br>

      </p>
      <h3> Length</h3>
      <p>
        Many propeties in CSS use length as values. For example, width, height, box-shadow, padding, margins, font-spacing...<br>
        Knowing what you just learned about absolute and relative units, here are absolulte and relative <i>length</i> units.<br>
        <strong>Absolute</strong> length units are: 'pt', 'px' 'in' 'q' <br >
        <strong>Relative</strong> length units are: 'em', 'rem', 'ex', 'ch', 'vw', 'vh', 'vmin', 'vmax'<br >
        <br>
        Lets start off with some absolute units:
      </p>
      <h3>Absolute Lengths</h3>
      <h4>px</h4>
      <p>
      The pixel. To popular dismay, the CSS pixel length doesn't equate to the actual pixels used to render images on your screen/device.<br>
      1px === 1/96th of 1 in 
      </p>
      <h4>cm</h4>
      <p> 
        Yup, cm stands for centimeter. Since 98% of the world uses the metric system, using cm could be helpful when you know the<br>
        physical properties of the output medium.
        1 cm === 37.8 px
      </p>
      <h4>q</h4>
      <p>
        Only available in Firefox, using q ( quarter of a millimeter) equates to or 1/30th of a centimeter. I

        <ul>
          <li>length</li>
          <li>percent</li>
          <li>fraction unit</li>
          <li>measurement of content</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Length</h3>
        Lengths are either horizontal or vertical.
        <ul>
          <li>px</li>
          <li>em</li>
          <li>rem</li>
          <li>vh</li>
          <li>vw</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
          <li>px</li>
          <li>em</li>
          <li>rem</li>
          <li>vh</li>
          <li>vw</li>
        </ul>
